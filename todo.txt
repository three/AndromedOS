== TODO ==

- Properly load memory map
    Due to the way the memory map is stored, if it is sufficiently long enough,
    the map will overflow the allocated space for it into stack space.
    Additionally, not enough error detection is done when calling 0x15

- Detect OS is safe to copy from memory map
    The only memory we can guarantee to be safe is 0x500 to 0x7FFFF. Before
    loading the bootloader into 0x100000, Boot2 should check the memory map
    to make sure this is safe.

- Continue 32bit code
    This includes proper keyboard input, proper text output, loading IVT, etc.

- Reorganize terminal module
    The terminal module is inconsistent in how it writes to screen for different
    logging functions. A standard where logging works by passing position in and
    retrieving from function of memsafe logging should be adopted before start
    of shell.
